1. Inside of your ERD please backup the reasoning behind why
 you decided to use the relationships you chose. You can do so by
 adding text to the bottom of the ERD.


 I chose thise relationships because I table connecting 
 by using PK and FK. In this way, we can pull out data from another 
 table by the key ID. My structure is straight forward
 1. Have customers come in and check the movies 
 2. One that ppick movies connecting with cashier for payment
 3. Print ticket with information table 
 4. User have option to buy drink on concession 
 5. Now linked the ticket to seat and connect seat to the room
